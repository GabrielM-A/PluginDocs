Instead of relying on real-time world rendering, it uses a screenshot or texture-based approach—offering a more efficient and lightweight solution. Key features include zooming, rotation, screen-space icon widgets, and multiplayer support.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="Banner"></p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="test"></p><ul><li><strong>MinimapCaptureActor</strong>: This actor captures the minimap screenshot and saves it to the game directory.</li><li><strong>MinimapComponent</strong>: This component is added to the player character and handles the minimap&#39;s functionality, including zooming and rotation.</li><li><strong>WBP_MinimapInstance</strong>: This widget displays the minimap in the UI, allowing for interaction and customization.</li></ul><h2 id="performance" tabindex="-1">Performance <a class="header-anchor" href="#performance" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Performance&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The minimap system uses a texture-based material approach with non-live snapshot captures, avoiding the overhead of continuous real-time rendering. This means the map itself is lightweight and efficient, simply displaying a pre-rendered image of the world. Dynamic elements like player and actor icons are rendered using Slate widgets, which are drawn on top of the map and update only as needed. This hybrid approach offers strong performance benefits, especially in large or multiplayer worlds, as it avoids unnecessary scene captures or heavy UMG rendering. It strikes a balance between visual clarity and runtime efficiency, making it ideal for games that need responsive UI without sacrificing frame rate.</p>',7)]))}const f=i(o,[["render",m]]);export{u as __pageData,f as default};
